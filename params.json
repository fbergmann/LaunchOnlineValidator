{"name":"Launch SBML Online Validator","tagline":"SBW Module, sending an SBML model to the SBML Online Validator","body":"## Launch SBML Online Validator\r\nThis project hosts a simple web automation project, that enables SBW modules to send SBML models over to the SBML Online Validator. This is definitely convenient: \r\n\r\n![Launch SBML Online Validator](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/LaunchOnlineValidator/master/images/LaunchOnlineValidator.png)\r\n\r\nIf you launch the executable directly, it will open the SBML Online Validator. And if you launch the executable with an SBML file, that file will be send to the Validator. \r\n\r\nDownloads are as always hosted by SourceForge, the current version is: \r\n\r\n[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/files/modules/LaunchOnlineValidator/SetupSBMLValidator_1.0.exe/download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/files/modules/LaunchOnlineValidator/SetupSBMLValidator_1.0.exe/download)\r\n\r\n## Implementation \r\nWell to be honest, this project really just has a couple of lines of code. All the magic is actually leveraged by a nuget package `WatiN.2.1.0`. And whilte theoretically it would support a number of browsers, I could only get IE to work reliably for now. Then the magic happens in just one function: \r\n\r\n        public static void ValidateSBML(string sbml)\r\n        {\r\n            var browser = new IE(\"http://sbml.org/validator\");\r\n            browser.TextField(Find.ByName(\"rawSBML\")).Value =\r\n                            sbml;\r\n\r\n            var link = \r\n                browser.\r\n                    Links.FirstOrDefault(s => s.Url.Contains(\"fromPaste\"));\r\n            if (link != null)\r\n                link.Click();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n## License \r\nThis project is open source and freely available under the [Simplified BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license.
